Very simple drawing app using Node, Express, Socket.io  for real-time communication. Vanilla JS and HMTL5 Canvas for the Front-End. De-bugged using Colorjs and Node-Inspector.

Credit: Initial Project idea from Martin Angelov tutorial (on http://tutorialzine.com/2012/08/nodejs-drawing-game) but adapted and enhanced significantly to make it my own. Avoided jQuery to learn more about native JS DOM manipulation.
